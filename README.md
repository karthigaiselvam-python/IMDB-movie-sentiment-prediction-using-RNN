# IMDB-movie-sentiment-prediction-using-RNN
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using the IMDB movie review dataset. It uses an RNN-based deep learning model with word embeddings and LSTM layers to understand the context of each review. The model learns patterns from thousands of labeled reviews and predicts whether a new review is positive or negative. Text preprocessing such as tokenization, encoding, and padding is performed to prepare input data. The trained model provides accurate sentiment predictions and demonstrates how RNNs handle sequential text effectively. This project is ideal for learning NLP fundamentals and deep learning concepts.
